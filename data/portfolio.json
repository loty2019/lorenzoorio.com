Robotics Meets AI & 5G\" at UMass Boston, featuring the esteemed professor Bruno Siciliano from the University of Naples Federico II. ü§ñüß†üì°\n\nThis event brought together students, faculty, and robotics enthusiasts to explore cutting-edge advancements at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and 5G technology. Professor Siciliano's insights into the future potential of these technologies were both thought-provoking and motivating. We discussed how these advancements are reshaping industries and creating new opportunities.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to Oracle, the Deans of Students, the Computer Science & Engineering Department, and our Student Robotics Club for their invaluable support in making this event a success. And, of course, our deepest appreciation to Bruno Siciliano for joining us and sharing his expertise. Events like these remind us of the incredible impact that collaboration and innovation can have on the future.\n\nLooking forward to more inspiring collaborations like this!\n"}],"aboutpara":"I‚Äôm a developer, tech enthusiast, and someone who‚Äôs always been curious about how things work‚Äîfrom the servers that keep the internet running to the planes flying overhead. Originally from Italy, I moved to the U.S. to study computer science and push myself out of my comfort zone. That decision shaped how I approach everything: with a mindset to explore, adapt, and build.\n\nI‚Äôve worked on a bit of everything‚Äîweb development, embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, and even automation projects for smart homes and servers. I run my own homelab, not just as a hobby, but as a way to simulate real-world production environments and stay sharp with tools like Kubernetes, TrueNAS, and Proxmox. When I‚Äôm not coding or tinkering with hardware, I‚Äôm probably reading about aviation systems or watching planes take off.\n\nI bring a mix of structured thinking and laid-back creativity. I believe in working hard but keeping things human‚Äîtech should be practical, clear, and honestly a little fun. Whether it‚Äôs solving a problem for a client or hacking on a side project, I care about doing things the right way and learning something new in the process.","resume":{"tagline":"I'm a software and cybersecurity engineer","description":"","experiences":[{"id":"1","dates":"June 2020 ‚Äì September 2023","type":"Part Time","position":"Software Lab Intern @ Academy of Digital Odontostomatology (AIOD)","bullets":"Created and helped project-manage over 100 dental surgery cases utilizing software like Exocad and 3Shape. , Collaborated with a team of doctors and patients to ensure 100% of issues were identified early and solutions found in a proactive manner.","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTPUMg9G-svM69QhS9HsxUg/videos"},{"id":"d495c23b-4f65-479a-9b8a-cfbc1c089725","dates":"September 2022 ‚Äì September 2024","type":"Part Time","position":"Software Engineering Tutor @ University Of Massachusetts Boston ","bullets":"Supervised 30 students per week by actively tracking improvements design and development of both software and the students to deliver functional software projects. , Held weekly group session boosting teamwork and collaborative learning by at least 50%.","link":"https://www.umb.edu/science-mathematics/student-success-center/"},{"id":"077dea00-439e-49ae-a625-5b11ba315308","dates":"September 2023 ‚Äì September 2024","type":"Part Time","position":"Course Assistant for Data Structures and Algorithms @ University Of Massachusetts Boston ","bullets":"Assisting 60 students 4 times a week in learning data structure - syntax and algorithms in Python and Java. ,  Assisting in visualizing and approaching complex problems.
