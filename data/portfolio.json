I love merging software and hardware to create interactive experiences that people can genuinely enjoy. My interests span automation, cybersecurity, data science, and web development—if it’s tech, I’m all in. \n When I’m not tinkering with gadgets or code, you’ll find me behind a camera, capturing moments as they happen. I’m also into cars—whether it’s exploring the latest automotive tech or just hitting the road, I enjoy the thrill of seeing machines in action. For me, it’s all about making stuff work and enjoying the results, whether it’s in a project, a photo, or under the hood.","resume":{"tagline":"👋  I'm a software engineer.","description":"****","experiences":[{"id":"1","dates":"June 2020 – September 2023","type":"Part Time","position":"Software Lab Intern @ Academy of Digital Odontostomatology (AIOD)","bullets":"Created and helped project-manage over 100 dental surgery cases utilizing software like Exocad and 3Shape. , Collaborated with a team of doctors and patients to ensure 100% of issues were identified early and solutions found in a proactive manner.","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTPUMg9G-svM69QhS9HsxUg/videos"},{"id":"d495c23b-4f65-479a-9b8a-cfbc1c089725","dates":"September 2022 – September 2024","type":"Part Time","position":"Software Engineering Tutor @ University Of Massachusetts Boston ","bullets":"Supervised 30 students per week by actively tracking improvements design and development of both software and the students to deliver functional software projects. , Held weekly group session boosting teamwork and collaborative learning by at least 50%.","link":"https://www.umb.edu/science-mathematics/student-success-center/"},{"id":"077dea00-439e-49ae-a625-5b11ba315308","dates":"September 2023 – September 2024","type":"Part Time","position":"Course Assistant for Data Structures and Algorithms @ University Of Massachusetts Boston ","bullets":"Assisting 60 students 4 times a week in learning data structure, syntax, and algorithms in Python and Java. ,  Assisting in visualizing and approaching complex problems.
